# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Created a basic portfolio page using HTML and CSS. 

USER STORY:

AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

/* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport */
